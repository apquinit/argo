# Argo: A Powerful, Opinionated Web Framework for Go

Argo is a modern, powerful, and opinionated web framework for Go, designed to streamline the development of scalable and maintainable server applications. Inspired by the principles of efficiency, organization, and developer happiness, Argo offers a suite of features and tools that make it easier for teams to deliver exceptional software with ease.

## Why the Name "Argo"? ⛵

### 1. **AR + Go**

The name combines "AR" (AR Data Tech) with "Go", the language it’s built on. This reflects both its foundation and its purpose: a clean, efficient framework built on Go's strengths to help developers build better applications.

### 2. **The Legendary Ship**

In Greek mythology, Argo was the ship that carried Jason and his crew on an epic journey to find the Golden Fleece. Just like the ship, this framework is designed to help developers navigate the challenges of web development and deliver something great.

So, Argo is all about building with Go, keeping things structured, and helping you "sail" through development smoothly!

## Core Features

### 1. **Developer-Friendly CLI**

Argo's command-line interface (CLI) is at the heart of the framework, providing intuitive commands to help developers generate and manage projects. The CLI supports:

- **Project scaffolding**: Quickly generate new server applications with pre-configured settings.
- **Boilerplate generation**: Easily create controllers, models, migrations, and seeders.
- **Environment management**: Built-in support for environment-specific configurations.

### 2. **Built-In Database Management**

Argo simplifies database management with:

- **Models**: Define database models with struct tags for easy mapping.
- **Migrations**: Automatically generate and manage database schema changes.
- **Seeders**: Populate the database with initial or testing data.

### 3. **Modular Architecture**

Argo enforces a modular structure to keep projects organized and maintainable.

### 4. **Built-In Routing**

With support for route groups, middleware, and named routes, Argo makes defining and managing application routes straightforward.

### 5. **Middleware Support**

Easily integrate middleware for features like authentication, logging, or request validation. Argo provides default middleware but allows custom implementation for specific needs.

### 6. **Efficient ORM**

Argo integrates with GORM, providing a powerful and intuitive ORM for interacting with databases.

### 7. **Dependency Injection**

Built-in support for dependency injection (DI) makes it easier to manage application components and services.

### 8. **Testing Utilities**

Argo provides utilities to simplify writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
